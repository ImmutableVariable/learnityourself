# What Programming Language Should I Learn?

Choosing a language to start with is a difficult decision. With so many options (such as C++, Java, Python, etc), it can definitely be overwhelming. This article will help you come to a decision and guide you through the process of learning programming.

## Why Learn a Programming?

Its important to address the question, "Why should I learn programming?" My answer is this:

1. **Problem Solving** - Learning to program helps develop important problem solving skills. These skills are important for anyone, not just programmers. By learning programming, you can break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts (and hopefully find a solution).
2. **It's Fun!** - Although it is definitely not easy at the start, once you start to understand it, programming is VERY fun. It allows you to create software that others can interact with. 
3. **Job Opportunities** - Although there has been a decline in job opportunities for programmers, there are still many opportunities out there. I would not suggest learning programming just for the sake of money (because truthfully there are much easier ways to make money), but it is definitely a good skill to have.

## Which Programming Language Should I Learn?

There are many factors to choose from. I just chose the most common ones.

### What Field?

Before deciding a programming language, there are a few things to consider. One of the key considerations is **what field you plan to enter**. For example, if you want to become a web developer, Javascript is the main language you should learn. However, if you want to become a data scientist, Python is one of the most popular options. Below is a table and their most used fields:


| **Programming Language** | **Fields**                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Python**               | Data Science, Machine Learning, Web Development (server-side), Automation, Scripting                                              |
| **JavaScript**, HTML/CSS           | Web Development (client-side and server-side, used with HTML and CSS), Mobile App Development (with frameworks like React Native) |
| **Java**                 | Web Development (server-side), Enterprise Applications, Android Development                                                       |
| **C++**                  | General Programming, Game Development (less popular than C#), Systems Programming                                                 |
| **C#**                   | General Programming, Game Development (especially with Unity), Windows Applications                                               |
| **Swift (iOS), Kotlin (Android)** | Mobile App Development |

### What Type of Project?
Along with this, consider the type of projects that you want to do. For example

- If you want to create a website, you should learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This will allow you to create the front-end (everything you see) as well as the server it runs on.
- If you want to build a game, you should learn C++ or C#.
- If you want to build a mobile app, you should learn Kotlin or Swift.
- Anything related to data science or machine learning, you should learn Python.

### Difficulty

However you should also consider the difficulty of a language. Languages like C++ are far more difficult than languages like Python or JavaScript. You should choose a language that is easier to learn and use.

### Other Considerations

Start with something that is interesting to you. Even if it is more difficult, it ultimately up to you. If something isn't interesting to you, you will not enjoy learning it or programming in it. 

**Note: I recommend starting with python if you are unsure of which language to learn. Python is fairly easy to learn and has a large user base.**
