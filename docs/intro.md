# Welcome to LearnItYourself

At LearnItYourself, we believe that learning to code should be an adventure, not a chore. That said, we've created a platform where you can master programming languages at your own pace, with your own style, and on your own terms, but with our guidance of course!

Our platform isn't just another coding tutorial site, it's a comprehensive learning ecosystem designed to take you from curious beginner to confident creator. We will focus on project-based learning that builds real-world skills you can immediately apply.

## Why Choose LearnItYourself?

- **Self-paced**: Learn when and how you want
- **Open sourced**: This project is fully open source! Members of the community or experienced programmers are free to contribute.
- **FREE**: Completely free. In fact, you cant even make a account (yet)

We are currently working on our python curriculum; however, in the future we would like to add other languages such as Html, Css, Javascript, Rust, and others. We are also working on a blog!

Don't just learn to codeâ€”learn to create, solve, and innovate. Because the best way to learn is to do it yourself.
