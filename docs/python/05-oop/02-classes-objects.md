# Classes and Objects

In Python, classes and objects are fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). Think of a **class** as a blueprint or template. It defines what something should look like and how it should behave, but it isn't the thing itself. An **object** is an instance of a classâ€”an actual "thing" created from the blueprint. 

To use an analogy:
- A class is like a cookie cutter
- An object is like a cookie made with that cookie cutter

## Creating a Class in Python

A class is defined using the `class` keyword followed by the class name and a colon:

```python
class Dog:
    # Class attribute (shared by all instances)
    species = "Canis familiaris"
    
    # Initializer / Constructor method
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        # Instance attributes (unique to each instance)
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    
    # Instance method
    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Woof!"
    
    # Another instance method
    def get_info(self):
        return f"{self.name} is {self.age} years old"
```

Let's break this down:

- `class Dog:` - This defines a new class called `Dog`.
- `species = "Canis familiaris"` - This is a class attribute. A class attribute is a variable that belongs to the class and not to any specific instance of the class. 
- `__init__` - This is a special method called when a new object is created, its also known as a constructor. When you create a new object, Python automatically calls this method.
- `self` - This parameter refers to the instance being created. It's a convention in Python to name it `self`.
- `bark()` and `get_info()` - These are instance methods (functions that belong to a specific instance of the class). They take `self` as their first parameter.

## Creating Objects (Instances)

This is the same class as above; however, this time we are creating objects (instances) of the class.

```python
###### Same class as above
class Dog:
    # Class attribute (shared by all instances)
    species = "Canis familiaris"
    
    # Initializer / Constructor method
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        # Instance attributes (unique to each instance)
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    
    # Instance method
    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Woof!"
    
    # Another instance method
    def get_info(self):
        return f"{self.name} is {self.age} years old"
######

# Creating instances of the Dog class
# Notice that we don't include the `self` parameter, since that is handled automatically by python
# Also notice that the parameters are the same as the ones in the class (name, age)
buddy = Dog("Buddy", 9)
miles = Dog("Miles", 4)

# Accessing attributes
print(buddy.name)        # Output: Buddy
print(miles.age)         # Output: 4
print(buddy.species)     # Output: Canis familiaris

# Calling methods
print(buddy.bark())      # Output: Buddy says Woof!
print(miles.get_info())  # Output: Miles is 4 years old
```

## The `self` Parameter

You might wonder about this `self` parameter that appears in all the methods. In Python, instance methods always take the instance as the first parameter, conventionally named `self`. When you call a method on an object, Python automatically passes the object as the first argument.

```python
# These two lines are equivalent
buddy.bark()
Dog.bark(buddy)
```

> The `self` parameter is one of those things that trips up beginners. Just remember, when you define a method inside a class, you always include `self` as the **first** parameter, but when you call that method on an object, you **don't pass anything** for `self` because Python handles that automatically!

## Instance Attributes vs. Class Attributes

We've seen two types of attributes:

1. **Instance attributes**: Defined in `__init__` and attached to `self`. Each object has its own copy.
2. **Class attributes**: Defined directly in the class. Shared by all instances of the class.

```python
class Dog:
    # Class attribute
    species = "Canis familiaris"
    count = 0
    
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        # Instance attributes
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        # We can access class attributes through self or the class name
        Dog.count += 1
    
    @classmethod
    def get_count(cls):
        return f"There are {cls.count} dogs"

# Create some dogs
dog1 = Dog("Buddy", 9)
dog2 = Dog("Charlie", 5)

# All dogs share the same species
print(dog1.species, dog2.species)  # Canis familiaris Canis familiaris

# But each has its own name and age
print(dog1.name, dog1.age)  # Buddy 9
print(dog2.name, dog2.age)  # Charlie 5

# We can access the count through the class
print(Dog.get_count())  # There are 2 dogs
```
<codapi-snippet sandbox="python" editor="python" init-delay="500">
</codapi-snippet>

The difference between class attributes and instance attributes is that class attributes are shared by all instances of the class, while instance attributes are unique to each instance. In this sample, `species` is a class attribute, while `name` and `age` are instance attributes. The speicies of all dogs is the same, but each dog has a unique name and age.

## Methods in Python Classes

Python classes can have several types of methods:

### 1. Instance Methods

Methods that operate on the instance (object), not the class. Defined using the `def` keyword and take `self` (the instance) as their first parameter.

```python
def bark(self):
    return f"{self.name} says Woof!"
```

### 2. Class Methods

Methods that are related to the class but don't operate on instances are defined using the `@classmethod` decorator.

```python
@classmethod
def get_count(cls):
    return f"There are {cls.count} dogs"
```

### 3. Static Methods

Methods that are related to the class but don't operate on instances or the class itself. Defined using the `@staticmethod` decorator.

```python
@staticmethod
def is_adult(age):
    return age >= 2
```

Let's put these all together:

```python
class Dog:
    species = "Canis familiaris"
    count = 0
    
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        Dog.count += 1
    
    # Instance method
    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Woof!"
    
    # Class method
    @classmethod
    def get_count(cls):
        return f"There are {cls.count} dogs"
    
    # Static method
    @staticmethod
    def is_adult(age):
        return age >= 2

# Let's try these methods
dog1 = Dog("Buddy", 9)

# Instance method - needs an instance to call
print(dog1.bark())  # Buddy says Woof!

# Class method - can be called on the class
print(Dog.get_count())  # There are 1 dogs

# Static method - can be called on the class or an instance
print(Dog.is_adult(1))  # False
print(dog1.is_adult(dog1.age))  # True
```

</codapi-snippet>

#### Decorators

A decorator is a shortcut to calling a wrapper function that "wraps" around another function. It allows you to modify the behavior of a function or class without changing its implementation. In the example, @classmethod is a decorator that marks the is_adult method as a class method, this is the same as writing:

```python
@classmethod 
def is_adult(cls, age):
    return age >= 2

# is the same as

is_adult = classmethod(is_adult)
```

## Adding More Functionality

We can also add even more functionality to our Dog class!

```python
class Dog:
    species = "Canis familiaris"
    
    def __init__(self, name, age, breed):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.breed = breed
        self.tricks = []  # Initialize an empty list
    
    def bark(self):
        if self.breed.lower() == "chihuahua":
            return f"{self.name} says Yip yip!"
        else:
            return f"{self.name} says Woof!"
    
    def learn_trick(self, trick):
        self.tricks.append(trick)
        return f"{self.name} has learned to {trick}!"
    
    def perform_trick(self, trick):
        if trick in self.tricks:
            return f"{self.name} performs {trick}!"
        else:
            return f"{self.name} doesn't know how to {trick}."
    
    def birthday(self):
        self.age += 1
        return f"{self.name} is now {self.age} years old!"

# Create a dog and interact with it
buddy = Dog("Buddy", 3, "Golden Retriever")
tiny = Dog("Tiny", 2, "Chihuahua")

print(buddy.bark())    # Buddy says Woof!
print(tiny.bark())     # Tiny says Yip yip!

print(buddy.learn_trick("sit"))  # Buddy has learned to sit!
print(buddy.learn_trick("roll over"))  # Buddy has learned to roll over!
print(buddy.perform_trick("sit"))  # Buddy performs sit!
print(buddy.perform_trick("play dead"))  # Buddy doesn't know how to play dead.

print(buddy.birthday())  # Buddy is now 4 years old!
```

## Multiple Objects Interacting

You can also create multiple objects and have them interact with each other!

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed
        self.toys = []
    
    def add_toy(self, toy):
        self.toys.append(toy)
        return f"{self.name} got a new {toy.name}!"
    
    def play_with_toy(self, toy_name):
        for toy in self.toys:
            if toy.name == toy_name:
                return toy.use(self.name)
        return f"{self.name} doesn't have a {toy_name}."

class Toy:
    def __init__(self, name, sound):
        self.name = name
        self.sound = sound
    
    def use(self, dog_name):
        return f"{dog_name} plays with the {self.name} and it makes a {self.sound} sound!"

# Create dogs and toys
buddy = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")
rex = Dog("Rex", "German Shepherd")

ball = Toy("ball", "bounce")
squeaky = Toy("squeaky toy", "squeak")
frisbee = Toy("frisbee", "whoosh")

# Give toys to dogs
print(buddy.add_toy(ball))  # Buddy got a new ball!
print(buddy.add_toy(squeaky))  # Buddy got a new squeaky toy!
print(rex.add_toy(frisbee))  # Rex got a new frisbee!

# Let dogs play with their toys
print(buddy.play_with_toy("ball"))  # Buddy plays with the ball and it makes a bounce sound!
print(buddy.play_with_toy("frisbee"))  # Buddy doesn't have a frisbee.
print(rex.play_with_toy("frisbee"))  # Rex plays with the frisbee and it makes a whoosh sound!
```

</codapi-snippet>

## The `__str__` and `__repr__` Methods

When you print an object or use it in a string context, Python calls the object's `__str__` method automatically. When you represent an object in a development context (like in a debugger or the REPL), Python calls `__repr__`. Long story short, you can actually override these automatically generated methods in order to provide your own string representations of your objects. This can be particularly helpful with complex objects that have a lot of attributes and methods.

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age, breed):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.breed = breed
    
    def __str__(self):
        """Return a human-friendly string representation"""
        return f"{self.name}, a {self.age}-year-old {self.breed}"
    
    def __repr__(self):
        """Return a developer-friendly string representation"""
        return f"Dog('{self.name}', {self.age}, '{self.breed}')"

buddy = Dog("Buddy", 9, "Golden Retriever")

# Using str() or print() calls __str__
print(str(buddy))  # Buddy, a 9-year-old Golden Retriever
print(buddy)       # Same as above

# Using repr() calls __repr__
print(repr(buddy))  # Dog('Buddy', 9, 'Golden Retriever')

# In a list, repr() is used
dogs = [buddy, Dog("Miles", 4, "Jack Russell")]
print(dogs)  # [Dog('Buddy', 9, 'Golden Retriever'), Dog('Miles', 4, 'Jack Russell')]
```
<codapi-snippet sandbox="python" editor="python" init-delay="500">
</codapi-snippet>

> The `__repr__` method is super handy when debugging. A good rule of thumb is to make `__repr__` return a string that, if evaluated, would recreate the object. Think of it as the "code representation" of your object!

## Summary

Key Points: 
- Classes are blueprints for creating objects
- Objects are instances of classes with their own data
- Attributes store data inside objects
- Methods define behavior for objects
- Special methods like `__init__`, `__str__`, and `__repr__` provide core functionality
