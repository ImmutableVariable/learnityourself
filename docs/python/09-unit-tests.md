# Unit Testing

Unit testing is the practice of testing individual components of your code to ensure they work correctly. Think of it like checking each ingredient before cooking a complex meal. Before combining everything into your final dish, you taste each component separately: Is the sauce seasoned correctly? Is the pasta cooked to the right texture? Are the vegetables properly prepared?

In the same way, in Python, a "unit" typically refers to a single ingredient of your program—a function, class, or method. By testing these units individually, you can verify that each part functions as expected, catch "spoiled ingredients" (bugs) early in development, and make changes with confidence knowing your tests will alert you if something breaks. Just as a chef wouldn't serve a dish without tasting the components, a good programmer doesn't deploy code without testing the units.

## Why Unit Testing Matters

Unit tests provide several key benefits:

1. **Catch bugs early**: Find and fix issues before they reach production
2. **Enable refactoring**: Change code structure without changing functionality
3. **Document code**: Tests show how functions are expected to behave
4. **Support collaboration**: Help team members understand how code should work
5. **Build confidence**: Make changes without fear of breaking existing functionality

```python
# Without tests, you might not notice this bug
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a - b  # Oops! This should be a + b

# With tests, the bug would be caught immediately
```

## Python's Testing Frameworks

Python offers several testing frameworks. We'll focus on `unittest` (built into Python's standard library) and `pytest` (a popular third-party framework).

### The unittest Framework

The `unittest` framework is included with Python and doesn't require additional installation (which is nice):

```python
import unittest

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

class TestAddFunction(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_add_positive_numbers(self):
        self.assertEqual(add(1, 2), 3)
    
    def test_add_negative_numbers(self):
        self.assertEqual(add(-1, -1), -2)
    
    def test_add_mixed_numbers(self):
        self.assertEqual(add(-1, 1), 0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Key components of a `unittest` test:
1. Create a class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`
2. Write methods that start with `test_`
3. Use assertion methods like `assertEqual`, `assertTrue`, or `assertRaises`
4. Run tests with `unittest.main()`

### The pytest Framework

`pytest` is a third-party framework that's more streamlined than `unittest`:

```python
# Install with: pip install pytest

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# Test functions start with "test_"
def test_add_positive_numbers():
    assert add(1, 2) == 3

def test_add_negative_numbers():
    assert add(-1, -1) == -2

def test_add_mixed_numbers():
    assert add(-1, 1) == 0

# Run with: pytest test_file.py
```

Key features of `pytest`:
1. Simple syntax using Python's `assert` statement
2. Automatic test discovery
3. Detailed error reports
4. Extensible with plugins

## Writing Effective Unit Tests

A good unit test should be:

1. **Fast**: Tests should run quickly
2. **Independent**: One test shouldn't depend on another
3. **Repeatable**: Same result every time
4. **Self-validating**: Pass or fail without manual inspection
5. **Timely**: Written at the same time as the code

### Test Structure: Arrange-Act-Assert

Most tests follow this pattern:

```python
def test_some_function():
    # Arrange - set up test data
    a = 1
    b = 2
    expected = 3
    
    # Act - call the function being tested
    result = add(a, b)
    
    # Assert - check the result
    assert result == expected
```

### Testing Edge Cases

Always test edge cases, not just the "happy path":

```python
def divide(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
    return a / b

def test_divide_by_zero():
    import pytest
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        divide(5, 0)
```

Common edge cases include:
- Empty inputs (empty strings, lists, etc.)
- Boundary values (minimum/maximum values)
- Invalid inputs
- Special cases (zero, negative numbers, etc.)

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Test-Driven Development is a practice where you write tests before writing code:

1. Write a failing test for a new feature
2. Write the simplest code to make the test pass
3. Refactor the code to improve design

```python
# Step 1: Write a failing test
def test_multiply():
    assert multiply(2, 3) == 6  # This will fail because multiply doesn't exist yet

# Step 2: Write minimal code to make the test pass
def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

# Step 3: Refactor if needed
```

## Testing with Dependencies

Real-world code often depends on external systems. For testing, you should isolate your code from these dependencies using:

### Mock Objects

Mocks are simulated objects that mimic the behavior of real objects:

```python
from unittest.mock import Mock

# Instead of calling a real database
database = Mock()
database.get_user.return_value = {"id": 1, "name": "Alice"}

def test_get_user_name():
    user = database.get_user(1)
    assert user["name"] == "Alice"
```

### Fixtures

Fixtures provide reusable test data or setup:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.fixture
def sample_data():
    return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

def test_calculate_average(sample_data):
    average = sum(sample_data) / len(sample_data)
    assert average == 3
```

## Organizing Tests

As your project grows, organize your tests to keep them manageable:

1. **Separate test files**: Create test files alongside your code files
2. **Naming conventions**: Name test files with `test_` prefix
3. **Group related tests**: Keep related tests in the same class or file
4. **Test directory structure**: Mirror your project structure in your tests

```
my_project/
│
├── my_module/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── calculator.py
│
└── tests/
    ├── __init__.py
    └── test_calculator.py
```

## Running Tests

Running tests should be a regular part of your development workflow:

```bash
# Running all tests with unittest
python -m unittest discover

# Running all tests with pytest
pytest

# Running a specific test file
pytest tests/test_calculator.py

# Running a specific test
pytest tests/test_calculator.py::test_add
```

## Test Coverage

Test coverage measures how much of your code is tested:

```bash
# Install coverage
pip install pytest-cov

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=my_module

# Generate HTML coverage report
pytest --cov=my_module --cov-report=html
```

Aim for high coverage, but remember that 100% coverage doesn't guarantee bug-free code. Coverage helps identify untested parts of your code.

## Common Unit Testing Mistakes

1. **Testing implementation details**: Test what a function does, not how it does it
2. **Writing brittle tests**: Tests that break when you make minor changes
3. **Ignoring edge cases**: Failing to test boundary conditions
4. **Testing too much at once**: Unit tests should focus on small units
5. **Slow tests**: Tests should run quickly to be useful

## Best Practices

1. **Write tests early**: Don't postpone writing tests
2. **Keep tests simple**: Simple tests are easier to understand and maintain
3. **Test one thing per test**: Each test should verify a single behavior
4. **Use descriptive test names**: Names should explain what's being tested
5. **Run tests automatically**: Use continuous integration to run tests on every change
6. **Test behaviors, not methods**: Focus on what your code should do, not just testing methods for the sake of coverage
