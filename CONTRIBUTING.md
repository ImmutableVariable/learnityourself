## What to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to this project. Here are a few ideas:

- Grammar/Spelling fixes: This is a major help as it is quite hard to read through all of the pages!
- Content Improvements: If a example is outdated or incorrect, you can fix it.
- New code examples: If you have a better code sample (that is still understandable), you can add it.
- Bug fixes: If you find a bug, you can fix it.

## How to Contribute

Here is a guide on how to create your first contribution by github: [Contributing to a project](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project)

## Other notes

The lessons are within the "docs" folder. They are written within the markdown language. If you are adding a new code sample, simple write it as follows. 
\`\`\`{language}
{code}
\`\`\`

If the code you are creating can be executed (if the code requires a file system, it cannot be executed), you can write it as follows:

\`\`\`{language}
{code}
\`\`\`
<codapi-snippet sandbox="python" editor="basic" init-delay="500" >
</codapi-snippet>
